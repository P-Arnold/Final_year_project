# Final_year_project

This repository contains most of the code that was written and used during the process of completing my final year project.

I used the project as an opportunity to become familiar with python, however I failed to make use of virtual environments and so 
libraries were installed globally on my machine and python files ran individually.

Files were updated and changed along the way in a, sometimes, haphazard fashion.
